# React-Cuisine-App

A React project where users can order a hamburger and add various ingredients of their choice using a 
Burger Controller. The app also calculates the burger's price depending on the number of ingredients added and checks out the user. A simple form submission is attached where the user can add addresses, emails, and postal code for delivery.
